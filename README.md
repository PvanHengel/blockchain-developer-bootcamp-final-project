# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project

## Brainstorm

- Good Contract - a simple contract and GUI that allows users to 'stake' coins, but the income is collected and distributed to charity, the way charities are selected is by a vote by those who have staked coins via this contract.  A leader board, etc for each charity will be displayed.

- OAUTH flow - some sort of way to share private data behind API's with select users for a period of time, or particular API call.  Some way to secureley link your oauth and refresh tokens into a contract.
